echo "Last night I went to $NOUN1 for dinner. The food was $ADJ1 and $ADJ2, but I enjoyed the $NOUN2. Our waitress was kind of $ADJ3 because she kept on $VERB1 and she got our oder $ADJ4. She also dropped $NOUN3 on my mom's $NOUN4. My mom was really $ADJ5 because it ruined her $NOUN5. For dessert, we got a $NOUN6 that had $NOUN7 frosting. It was pretty good but when I was chewing a find a $NOUN8 in the middle. All in all, it was a $ADJ6 restaurant experience."
